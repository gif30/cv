  summary: |
    I've been working as a DevOps engineer for years now, honing my skills and knowledge along the way.
    I'm mostly self-taught, but I've also earned certifications because I genuinely enjoy learning and staying updated with the latest tech.
    Teaching, contributing, and helping others innovate? It's my thing. Technology is my passion, and I dive into it with excitement.
    I bring an analytical, curious, transparent, and open-minded approach to the table, which makes collaborating with others a breeze.
    If you'd like to know more about me and find my profile interesting, feel free to reach out! I'm eager to connect and explore opportunities.

  # I was born in 1998 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I attended a German school where I learned a lot about the language and culture.
  # I love learning new things, teaching, and contributing to innovation. That's why technology is my passion.
  # I am also analytical, curious, transparent, and open-minded, which greatly benefits my collaboration with others.
  # If you would like to know more about me and found my profile interesting, please don't hesitate to reach out!

  # I have been a DevOps engineer for years now. I'm mostly self-thought with some certifications because I love learning new things.

  # If you would like to know more about me and found my profile interesting, please don't hesitate to reach out!

  # Mi pasión está en poder mejorar la tecnología o estrategias que enriquezcan y mejoren nuestras vidas.
  # Aunque la educación allí estaba orientada a letras y ciencias naturales, descubrí con el tiempo que lo que me apasionaba realmente era resolver problemas y rompecabezas.
  # Por eso mismo la tecnología y la programación fue lo que mas me atrajo y decidí estudiar Ingeniería electrónica apenas termine el secundario.
  # Para expandir mis áreas de conocimiento y obtener experiencia laboral a temprana edad, decidí hacer un terciario en paralelo a la universidad como junior manager en administración industrial (Industriekaufmann).
  # Además de obtener conocimientos empresariales básicos, tuve mi primera experiencia laboral, donde fui rotando de sector en sector para tener un panorama general de todos los sectores de una empresa.
  # Una vez terminado dicho terciario Comencé mi carrera en una técnica donde trabaje por poco tiempo como ingeniero de redes y luego como ingeniero DevOps (mi trabajo actual)

  # summary: |
  #   Mi pro-actividad y mi interés por el aprendizaje son dos de mis cualidades mas altas.
  #   Esto no solo lo digo yo: se puede ver reflejado en mi actividad en el ultimo tiempo. Al apenas haber terminado el colegio, comencé a estudiar Ingeniería Electrónica, un terciario en administración industrial y complementando el terciario con mi primera experiencia laboral. Sumado a esto, en mi tiempo libre suelo trabajar en proyectos personales.
  #   Si eso no es ser pro-activo, entonces no se que lo será!
  #   Fuera de eso, se me da muy bien el compañerismo y el trabajo en equipo, manejando el respeto y la solidaridad, para poder llegar mucho más lejos entre todos.

    summary: |
      It all started with 2 friends with desire and curiosity to build a CNC router. Being the boom of 3D printing it ending beeing a proyect to build a printer.
      Most people buys a preasembled kit but in this case it took hours to design, forge and build piece by piece.
      It had many iterations and versions, until we finaly achieved our goal.
      We learnt a lot with this proyect which took a lot of work of investigation, efford, countless hours and teamwork.

  - name: TANKs
    summary: |
      This was a proyect I've built at the University with some partners.
      The idea was to build a robot to deliver goods autonomously in a predefined area (an office, a Warehouse or an open space).
      It consisted on a landmarked area and a robot with a compartment, some access control, proximity and light sensors and a remote connection
      Basically after loading the payload, you indicated the waypoint, and the robot realizes the delivery.
      By the way it worked, you could add or remove the routes easily which made it scalable and flexible to implement.
